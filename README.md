## Open Savannah 
Brigade Hub

This is the source code for Open Savannah's homepage and members portal, which is powered by the [BrigadeHub](http://brigadehub.github.io) project by [Code for San Francisco](codeforsanfrancisco.org).  It is currently deployed to https://opensav.herokuapp.com/.

The deployment is set to upgrade the site automatically upon changes to this repo.

The goal is to make this the main site for Open Savannah's projects, meetings, and general on-boarding.
