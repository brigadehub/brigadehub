### In a nutshell

BrigadeHub is an **beta** stage data portal for volunteer coding organizations. While being built for Code for America Brigades, it can be be used for any project-based coding organization. It's being built to consolidate the efforts of maintaining a brigade's information into a single location, to distribute the task of content creation across the various non-technical brigade roles, and to enhance the experience of both members and admins of these unique organizations.

For a complete top-down view of the roadmap, take a look at our active ***[Roadmap Wiki](https://github.com/brigadehub/brigadehub/wiki/Roadmap)*** (currently being worked on).

In short, BrigadeHub is designed to meet some very specific goals:

- Provide out-of-the-box utilities for organization admins:
  - Public facing website, with contact page, blog, project profiles and more
  - Admin dashboard
  - Robust content management permissioning and distribution
- Be easy to install and upkeep. You shouldn't have to dedicate a team just for your website anymore, nor should you need to know how to code to update your site.
- Be modular, extensible, and hackable. Brigadehub Core provides a simple REST API for minimal deployment if you already have your infrastructure in place.
- Allow brigades to communicate with each other quickly and effectively

### Ways to use

There are three different ways of interacting with/using Brigadehub:

- **Suite**: out of the box solution, best if you have no current site solution and don't want to deal with any coding. Swap out themes as you like with community-built solutions.
- **Admin Gateway**: Minimal API with a GUI admin gateway, best if you already have a website and want a way of dynamically generating the content of it. You'll need to read up on the Core API to tie it into your frontend, but once deployed, the data can be maintained by non-coders.
- **Mini**: This is just a REST API interface. Best if you already have an interface built out and just want to leverage the dataset of Brigadehub.

Depending on the needs of your organization, you'll want to decide which will work best for you.

*Note: Unless otherwise specified, links like `location.of.mongo` and `path/to/file` do not represent the actual link you need to use in your enviroment, and should be replaced with the appropriate locations.*

#### Suite

**Brigadehub Suite** is the flagship install of Brigadehub, and is more or less a ***brigade-in-a-box***. It installs three components: **Core**, **Admin Theme**, and **Public Theme**. It's deployed in such a way that you should never *need* to touch the code, but if you *want* to, it's a simple matter. It provides Admin tools to manage your brigade information, and a slick frontend to display the info you're managing. Your frontend developers can dynamically pull the data about your brigade via the Core API if they have external tools that need the same data. And you can rest assured that we'll be working on patches and updates over time to make this the most secure and stable platform ever.

###### Development Install

<details><summary><img src="http://lepbase.org/wp-content/themes/lepbase-dot-org/images/code-icon.png" height="25" /> Source (click to open)</summary><p>
To work on Brigadehub Suite as a developer, you need to clone and link internally all four portions of the suite. Fork all 4 repos into your desired organization or account, and work from those, making sure to update from upstream periodically.

***Pre-requisites***

- Git
- [Node 6.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A running mongo instance
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - For installation and package management (replaces NPM in this project)

***Installation and Running***

First, clone the following repositories into your own account, either your organization's org or your personal account:

- [brigadehub/brigadehub](https://github.com/brigadehub/brigadehub)
- [brigadehub/core](https://github.com/brigadehub/core)
- [brigadehub/theme-public-c4sf](https://github.com/brigadehub/theme-public-c4sf)
- [brigadehub/theme-admin-c4sf](https://github.com/brigadehub/theme-admin-c4sf)

Once you've forked all four, clone the repos locally (replacing `your-account` with the appropriate org/account name):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-account/brigadehub
git clone https://github.com/your-account/core
git clone https://github.com/your-account/theme-public-c4sf
git clone https://github.com/your-account/theme-admin-c4sf
```

In separate terminals, run the following:

```bash
cd theme-public-c4sf
make upstream/set
make install
make link
```

```bash
cd theme-admin-c4sf
make upstream/set
make install
make link
```

```bash
cd core
make upstream/set
make install
make link
```

```bash
cd brigadehub
make upstream/set
make install
make link
make start/develop
```

Any changes made in core, theme-public-c4sf, and theme-admin-c4sf will restart the server in brigadehub, and allow you to preview the changes. When you're done with your changes, make sure the tests pass via `make test`, and create a pull request from the appropriate repo.

***Sync Changes with Upstream***

To pull the most recent changes from `upstream/master`, run the following command:

```
make upstream/sync
```

This will fetch the upstream `master` branch and merge those changes into your local `master` branch.

***Push Changes Upstream***

To push your development changes back to the main brigadehub repo, push your changes up to your branch, and make a Pull Request into the upstream repository's `master` branch. Please include the following information in your pull request:

- A description of the problem you are addressing (or feature being added)
- A link to the related Github Issue (if applicable)
- If making changes to UI, screenshots of the changes presented
- List any deprecations that may be presented
- If you are a new contributor, your name, github handle, and (optionally) website for the maintainers list

Please keep in mind that application changes are subject to review and revision, and may be rejected at the project maintainers discretion.

</p></details>

#### Admin Gateway

**Brigadehub Admin Gateway** installs two components: **Core** and **Admin Theme**. Your frontend developers can dynamically pull the data about your brigade via the Core API, but you as an administrator should never need to touch the code. This is a good option if you already have a site and want to augment it with brigadehub data.

#### Mini

**Brigadehub Mini** installs only one component: **Core**. No Frontends will be deployed with this install, exposing only the authentication routes and REST APIs. This is an advanced setting, and should be only done if you already have a site and admin portal to manage on your own. All features are accessible via REST API (GraphQL to come soon)

To work on Brigadehub Mini as a developer, you need to clone and link internally both portions of the install. Fork both repos into your desired organization or account, and work from those, making sure to update from upstream periodically.

***Pre-requisites***

- Git
- [Node 6.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A running mongo instance
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - For installation and package management (replaces NPM in this project)

***Installation and Running***

First, clone the following repositories into your own account, either your organization's org or your personal account:

- [brigadehub/mini](https://github.com/brigadehub/mini)
- [brigadehub/core](https://github.com/brigadehub/core)

Once you've forked both repos, clone the repos locally (replacing `your-account` with the appropriate org/account name):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-account/mini
git clone https://github.com/your-account/theme-admin-c4sf
```

In separate terminals, run the following:

```bash
cd core
make upstream/set
make install
make link
```

```bash
cd mini
make upstream/set
make install
make link
make start/develop

Any changes made in core and theme-admin-c4sf will restart the server in mini, and allow you to preview the changes. When you're done with your changes, make sure the tests pass via `make test`, and create a pull request from the appropriate repo.


***Sync Changes with Upstream***

To pull the most recent changes from `upstream/master`, run the following command:

```
make upstream/sync
```

This will fetch the upstream `master` branch and merge those changes into your local `master` branch.

***Push Changes Upstream***

To push your development changes back to the main brigadehub repo, push your changes up to your branch, and make a Pull Request into the upstream repository's `master` branch. Please include the following information in your pull request:

- A description of the problem you are addressing (or feature being added)

#### Inspirations

Similar projects have been conceived and implemented previously ([Laddr](https://github.com/CfABrigadePhiladelphia/laddr), [Connector](https://github.com/codeforatlanta/connector), [Chime](https://github.com/chimecms/chime ), etc.), but for one reason or another didn't meet the needs of Code for San Francisco and many other brigades. Brigadehub hopes to bridge those infrastructure gaps.
